In the last decades, many companies have had a growing interest in "digital oil", also called Big Data. Data mining has been applied in these massive volumes of data to extract valuable information for clients and industries worldwide. Machine Learning, a prominent technique for data mining, can be used to extract patterns from data and induce models to predict future events. Still, complex environments that are constantly evolving usually generate non-stationary data streams. Thus, these models may perish in this scenario due to concept drift. Retraining periodically can help, but algorithm bias may no longer be appropriate. A response to this is to use meta-learning for regular algorithm selection in time-changing environments, choosing the hypothesis space that best suits the current data. In this work, we enhanced MetaStream, a framework for data stream algorithm selection, though a rich set of state-of-the-art meta-features, and an incremental learning approach in the meta-level based on LightGBM, combining this to actively select the best algorithm for the current concept in a time-changing environment. The results show that this new strategy can improve the recommendation accuracy of the best algorithm in time-changing data.
